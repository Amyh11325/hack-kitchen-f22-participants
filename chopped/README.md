# Welcome to Chopped!

Chopped is the first event in Hack Kitchen, and it is based on the popular TV show of the same name! In Chopped, contestants are given a mystery basket of ingredients and are tasked with creating a dish out of them. 

Your mission in this event will be the same. We will assign your team 3 random "ingredients" of a website, and you will be required to include them in your submission. 
For example, one such ingredient might be a navbar or a button. 

Your finished website should teach us how to cook your favorite dish. We will be judging it based on creativity and utilization of assigned ingredients. You will have 90 minutes to complete it.
